1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To stop the program running at our chosen point - the line at which we have discerened there may be an issue with the code.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, the program stops before the breakpoint line of code has been run.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Step over.

4. What does the step into command do?
Switches into a function that is being called so that we can examine what is happening there.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression allows you to enter a single line of code (to check the value of variables, etc), while evaluate code fragment allows you to enter multiple lines of code (including temporary variables, etc) to check the result of running that code.
